        <h2>Inigo Iribarren Aguirre</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            Iñigo carried out his chemistry studies at <b>“Universidad Autónoma de Madrid”</b> 
            as well as his master studies in <b>theoretical chemistry and computational modelling
            (TCCM)</b>. <br>
            He spent three months at <b> “Sorbonne Université”</b> in Paris under the supervision 
            of <b>Dr. Julia Contreras</b> developing a module for the Non-covalent interaction 
            index software that separates an interaction into orbitalic contributions. <br>
            <br>
            He carried out his master thesis at “Instituto de Química Médica (CSIC, Madrid)” 
            under the supervision of <b>Prof. Ibon Alkorta</b>. <br>
            This master thesis was focused on studying dimers formed by two protonated 
            monomers linked by hydrogen bonds and characterize those interactions 
            <a class="link-tfm" href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2019/cp/c8cp07542e"> 
                (Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2019,21, 5796-5802)</a>”. <br> <br>
            
            Currently, Iñigo is at <b>Trinity College Dublin</b> doing his PhD under the supervision 
            of <b> <a class="link-trg" href="https://www.trujilloresearchgroup.com"> Prof. Cristina Trujillo</a></b> focused on the computational design of novel 
            asymmetric organocatalysts. <br>
            He has also performed different side projects that resulted in several <b><a class="link-publications" href="./publications.html">publications</a></b>.
            <br>
            <br>
            Along with his research activity he has been involved in more than <b> 20 outreach 
            activities</b> all over Ireland with three different programs like 
            <i>Stories from the lab</i>, <i>Spectroscopy in a suitcase</i> and 
            <i>Energy investigators</i> in which he and other PhD students go to different high 
            schools engaging young students and showing them how chemistry looks at university 
            and all the different fields that form it. <br>
            <br>
            During this time he has also presented his work in more than <b> 10 symposiums and 
            conferences</b> and he was awarded with the <b> best flash talk award</b> at the 
            ICI postgraduate day in 2020.
