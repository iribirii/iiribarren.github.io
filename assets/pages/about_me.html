        <h2>Inigo Iribarren Aguirre</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            I carried out my chemistry studies at <i>“Universidad Autónoma de Madrid”</i> 
            as well as my master studies in <b>Theoretical Chemistry and Computational Modelling
            (TCCM)</b>. <br><br>
            During this time, I spent three months at <i> “Sorbonne Université”</i> in Paris under the supervision 
            of <b>Dr. Julia Contreras</b> developing a module for the Non-covalent interaction 
            index software that separates an interaction into orbitalic contributions. <br>
            <br>
            I carried out his master thesis at <i>“Instituto de Química Médica (CSIC, Madrid)”</i> 
            under the supervision of <b>Prof. Ibon Alkorta</b>. 
            This master thesis was focused on studying dimers formed by two protonated 
            monomers linked by hydrogen bonds and characterize those interactions 
            <a class="link-tfm" href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2019/cp/c8cp07542e"> 
            (Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2019,21, 5796-5802)</a>”. <br> <br>
            
            Currently, I am doing my Ph.D. at <b>Trinity College Dublin</b> under the supervision 
            of <b> <a class="link-trg" href="https://www.trujilloresearchgroup.com"> Prof. Cristina Trujillo</a></b>, 
            focused on the computational design of novel asymmetric organocatalysts and the study of the Non-Covalent Interactions
            governing the selectivity. <br>
            During this time I have also be involved in different side projects that resulted in several <b><a class="link-publications" href="./publications.html">publications</a></b>.
            <br>
            <br>
            Along with my research activity I have been involved in more many different <b> outreach 
            activities</b> all over Ireland, participating in three different programs such as  
            <i>Stories from the lab</i>, <i>Spectroscopy in a suitcase</i> and 
            <i>Current Energy investigators</i> in which I and other PhD students go to different high 
            schools, engaging young students and showing them how chemistry looks at university 
            and all the different fields that form it. <br>
            <br>
            During this time I have also presented my work in several symposiums and 
            conferences and I have been awarded with the <b> best flash talk award</b> at the 
            ICI postgraduate day in 2020, 
            the <b>best poster award</b> at 12th Triennial Congress of the World Association of Theoretical and Computational Chemists (WATOC2020)
            and the <b>best poster award</b> at the 3rd European Symposium on Chemical Bonding (CBOND2022).
